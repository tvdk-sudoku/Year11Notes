resources such as air, minerals, water, coal, oil\n\n#### Micro and Macroeconomics\n\n- The subject matter of economics is divided into micro and macroeconomics\n\n- **Macro**economics deals with the economic problem from society's point of view\n\n- It is concerned with the performance of the whole economy\n\n- **Micro**economics deals with economics from an individual point of view - referring to a small perspective\n\n#### Economic Models\n\n- A **simplified** representation of economic reality showing the relationship between certain economic variables\n\n- Not inclusive of all detailed;

A market consists of three elements\n- Buyers $\\rightarrow$ Create Demand\n- Sellers $\\rightarrow$ Create Supply\n- Something to exchange (goods \u0026 services)\n- Markets must be voluntary exchange\n- There exist [[#Competitive Markets]] and [[#Imperfect Markets]]\n- In the market system, the key economic questions are answered by the **price mechanism**\n- The consumer is king (consumer sovereignty), and they determine the answers to the BEP questions.\n- Markets are guided by self-interest on both the supply and demand side\n###### Competitive Markets\n- Characterised by;\n- A large number of buyers and sellers\n- Firms being price takers\n- Homogenous products\n- Easy entry into market (no barriers)\n\n###### Imperfect Markets\n- Characterised by;\n- A small number of firms\n- Product differentiation\n- Firms being price setters\n- Restricted entry into market\n- An **extreme imperfect market** is a monopoly market, where the market is centred around one firm.\n- An oligopoly is a market with a few dominant firms\n\n#### Demand Side\n\n- Demand refers to the buying intentions of customers.\n- This is not a want; wants are desired but demands are desires characterised by an ability to actually buy.\n- Demand is governed by the law of demand\n- **Income effect** - higher income $\\rightarrow$ more purchasing power\n- **Substitution effect** - when the price of a substitute increases, the price of the good increases as it becomes more attractive to buyers.\n- The effects hold true always, as long as all other factors are constant\n\n###### Changes in the Demand Curve\n- There are two changes\n- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**\n- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**\n\n#### Supply Side\n- Represents the sellers or producers side of the market.\n- Rational, self-interested suppliers prefer to sell their output at a higher price than a lower one in order to maximise gain\n\n###### Changes in the Supply Curve\n- There are once again two changes\n- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**\n- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**\n\n#### Equilibrium\n- If we graph supply \u0026 demand on the same curve we can draw the equilibrium quantity and price as the points where the **two curves intersect**\n- Balances buying intentions of customer with selling intentions of supplier\n- If **the price is below the equilibrium**, there will be a **shortage**, and a **surplus** above.\n\n###### Shifts\n- When there are shifts in either curve, the equilibrium will change.

At the original price point, Quantity supplied, $Q_e$, exceeds Quantity demanded, $Q_2$. There is a temporary surplus from $Q_e$ to $Q_2$. Firms decrease the price to get rid of excess stock leading to a contraction along the supply curve, causing an expansion along the D curve.

At the original price point, quantity demanded, $Q_3$, exceeds quantity supplied, $Q_2$. There is a temporary shortage from $Q_2$ to $Q_3$. Consumers bid up the price leading to contraction along the demand curve, leading to an expansion along the supply curve. The temporary shortage is cleared and the new equilibrium point is at a higher price point, $P_2$, and at an indeterminate quantity, $Q_1$.\n\n##### Increase in supply, decrease in demand:\n\u003e There is new technology causing an increase in supply shifting the supply curve to the right from $S_1$ to $S_2$ and there is a decrease in disposable income causing a decrease in demand shifting the demand curve to the right from $D_1$ to $D_2$. At the original price point, quantity supplied, $Q_3$, exceeds quantity supplied, $Q_2$. There is a temporary surplus from $Q_2$ to $Q_3$.

Phones, computes\n\n\n### Barriers to Entry\n#### Economies of Scale\n- Permitting lower average costs to be achieved as the firm increases its size\n- Average total costs of a large firm are substantially lower the the average costs faced by a smaller firm\n- Large firm can charge a lower price\n\n#### Branding\n- Creation by a firm of a unique image and image of a product\n- Advertising campaigns that try to influence consumer tastes in favour of the product\n\n#### Control of Essential Resources\n- Monopolies can arise from ownership or control of an essential resource\n\n#### Aggressive Tactics\n- When existing firms use tactics to discourage new firms from entering the market\n- Are agreements or arrangements between firms that seek to restrain competition and remove the automatic regulation that competitive markets achieve\n\n##### Illegal Practices\n- **Cartel**: When firms agree to act or collude together instead of competing with each other other – includes both price fixing and market sharing\n- **Collusion**: General term describing agreements between firms – either price or market sharing – to reduce competition and increase profits\n- **Market Sharing**: A market is divided into a series of smaller markets, each supplied by one of the firms, thus reducing competition\n- **Collusive Tendering**: Firms agree to submit exorbitant tenders which ensure high profits and the sharing of work between the collusive members\n- **Predatory Pricing**: When a company with substantial market power sets is prices at a sufficiently low level with the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor\n- **Resale Price Maintenance**: The supplier sets the price at which a retailer must sell its products. The manufacturer may refuse to sell to any retailer which may resell their products at a discount\n- **Exclusive Dealing**: When one person trading with another imposes some restrictions on the other’s freedom to choose which whom or where they deal\n- **Collective Boycott**: When a group of competitors agree not to acquire goods or services from, or not to supply goods or services to, a business with whom the group is negotiating\n- **Merger**: Two or more firms join together to form one larger firm - prohibited if it substantially reduces competition in the market\n\n\n### Barriers to Entry (Legal)\n#### Patents\n- Rights given by the government to a firm that has developed a new product or invention to be its sole producer for a specified period of time\n- Will have a monopoly during this time\n\n#### Licenses\n- Granted by governments for particular professions or industries\n- Doesn't lead to monopoly but limits competition\n\n#### Copyrights\n- Guarantees that an author has the sole rights to copyrighted work\n\n#### Public Franchises\n- Granted to produce particular good or services\n\n#### Tariffs, Quotas and Other Trade Restrictions\n- Limits the quantities of a good that can be imported into a country, reducing competition\n\n## Market Power\n- A firm has market power if it is able to affect the market price by varying output\n- Firms in an imperfect markets have market power as they are able to do so\n\t- E.g.

It is located in the middle of a desert with nothing but sand and dust surrounding us in the harshest environment in the world. I have no idea how the inhabitants of this Town survived this long, but their houses are still intact. Barely.\n\nThe town consists of:\n- [M.Spicata](https://spicata.github.io/) is an important member of the town and owns a house, multi-story garden filled with fresh plants, and stall. He has a variety of things growing in his garden, including a budget comic series.\n- [DefinitelyEddie](https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/) lives in a quartz house and likes to keep his lights off, even with guests. He has made it very difficult to turn the lights on, and once they are on, you are instantly blinded. He love chemistry because it allows him to create m-[REDACTED]. (If you can't find the house, it will probably be because he has burnt it down again.)\n- [MacE](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/) has one of the best computer science libraries in the town. He also has good physics notes. His house is a bit different from everyone else because he built it with his good computer science skills.\n- [NotMario](https://notmario.github.io/thenotes/) has the other really good computer science libraries. It lacks detail in other subjects.\n- [Anonymous](https://anonymoof1528.github.io/into-the-shadow-garten/) is really good at Japanese which is the main focus of his house. We don't know much about this anonymous person, so enter at your own risk.\n- [NotTacoz](https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/) lives in/next to a Jacaranda tree. He imported it into the town for his home.\n- [Jonathan](https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/) lives in a quartz house that looks a lot like Ed's.\n- [Shan-Mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/) loves music and journals what she does in class. She is the youngest resident (year 9) and is allegedly dating Edward. Yes, there is a 2 year age difference, it just works.\n- [Pi-thagoras](https://pi-thagoras.github.io/the-chicken-pen/)'s house is just a chicken pen. Currently has econs, chem and jap notes. Be warned, it has a lot of bad puns.\n- And me :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-23T04:30:04.734497463Z","tags":null}}
