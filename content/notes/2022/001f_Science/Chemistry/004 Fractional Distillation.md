# Factional Distillation
[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]

Crude oil is a mixture composed mainly of straight and branched chain **alkanes**
The first step is to separate compounds in the oil into groups called fractions
Each **fraction** contains a mixture of compounds with a similar boiling point

The mixture is heated until all components evaporate, them cooled in such a fashion that substances condense separately
Substances with a higher boiling point condense before substances with a lower boiling point
Fractional distillation is used to separate crude oil into fraction with different boiling points

## Step by step

1. The oil is heated in a furnace.
2. Oil is heated to 350-400C, where it evaporates, and is pumped into the bottom of a tall tower called a fractionating column.
3. The column is very hot at the bottom but much cooler at the top; As the vaporized oil rises, it cools and condenses.
4. Heavy fractions (containing large molecules) have a high boiling point and condense near the bottom of the column.
5. Lighter fractions (containing small molecules) have a lower boiling point and condense further up the column.

### Order of fractions
1. Petroleum gas - heating + cooking
2. Gasoline - fuel
3. Naphtha - solvent + feedstock in chemical production
4. Paraffin/Kerosene - jet fuel + heating
5. Diesel - fuel for cars + lorries
6. Fuel oil - fuel for ships + large industrial boilers
7. Lubricating oil - lubricants
8. Bitumen - rood construction + waterproof roof material

## Molecule Size
Generally, the larger a hydrocarbon, the higher its boiling point.
This is because the intermolecular forces between large molecules are stronger than the intermolecular forces between small molecules
