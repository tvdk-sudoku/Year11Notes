### Mass Defect
- The difference in mass between a nucleus and the nucleons its made from.

The total mass of a stable nucleus is always less than the masses of the masses of the constituent nucleons.

mass defect = mass of nucleons - mass of nucleus

### Binding Energy
- Binding energy is RELEASED in the form of heat (kinetic energy of particles)

When a nucleus is formed, the mass defect has been converted into binding energy.
To split a nucleus back into nucleons, you have to put the binding energy back in, to replace the mass defect and split the nucleus into nucleus.

Mass defect and binding energy are related by Einstein's famous equation:
E = mc<sup>2</sup>

### Energy From Nuclear Reactions
Energy is released in a nuclear reaction when the binding energy of the products is greater than the binding energy of the reactants.


## Fission
Splitting a heavier nucleus into smaller nuclei.

Releases large amount of energy.
Often involves release of gamma photons and free neutrons.

## Fusion
Joining two lighter nuclei to form one heavier nucleus.
Releases a massive amount of energy.

Requires a huge amount of energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between nuclei - very high temperature required.
