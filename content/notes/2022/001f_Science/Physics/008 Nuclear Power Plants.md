Gamma rays are highly energetic photons of electromagnetic radiation. If they come into contact with the body they can cause cellular mutations, which can lead to cancer.

When handling radioactive material, the user should:
- use tongs, a glove box or robots
- be as far from the source as possible
- minimize exposure time


Pros
- Nuclear energy saves lives
- Cleaner
- New technology could reduce impact of nuclear waste

Cons
- Can produce nuclear weapons from waste products
- Accidents can cause severe damage to the environment
- Nuclear waste is toxic
